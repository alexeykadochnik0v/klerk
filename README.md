# Vue Component: Tree of Categories

This component displays a category tree with various features for easy interaction. The component allows you to:

- Display a tree of categories with a multi-level structure, including root and child categories.
- Visually collapse and expand tree branches at any level, making it easy to manage the display of nested items.
- Use a checkbox "Show empty categories" that allows you to include or exclude categories without events.
- Each category is represented as a link that directs to the corresponding page on the "Klerk" website.
- Next to each category, two numbers are displayed: the count of events in that category and the total count of events in that category including all its child categories.
- Each category has a checkbox that allows selecting the category and its child items. The sum of the selected categories' event counts is displayed at the top of the component.
- The checkboxes are managed such that each category is counted only once, even if it is part of multiple nested elements.

The component features a user-friendly interface with animations for expanding/collapsing branches and a loading indicator to make interaction smooth and visually appealing.
